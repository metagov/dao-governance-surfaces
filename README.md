# dao-governance-surfaces

Extract and label the "governance surface" of a set of DAO smart contracts. 

# Simple summary

An organization's governance surfce is the set of available actions through which it can adapt itself. In DAOs specifically, many of these actions are circumscribed by a smart contract which contains a set of parameters and the mechanisms for modifying them. 

This repository contains the tools for collecting the parameters and functions that define the governance surface into a series of linked objects and tables, including metadata about who is allowed to view a parameter or perform an action and keyword labels based on the variable names and plain-text comments in the code.

For a demonstration of how to use this code, set up the Python environment using `requirements.txt`, run `download_and_parse_contracts.py`, then run `factory_contracts.ipynb`

# Implementation

### Overall flow
Using the [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) generated by a Solidity parser, extract the contract and functions definitions (including their state variables or arguments and any associated enums, structs, modifiers, and events). Then, find any comments associated with these and attach them to the corresponding object or parameter. Finally, label each object or parameter based on the keywords found in the name or associated comments. Export two linked tables as CSV files.

## Data model
The data extracted about the smart contract governance surface is modeled by **`ContractObject`s** (a 'contract', 'event', 'modifier', 'function', 'struct', or 'enum' definition with properties such as `visibility`, `modifiers` for `function`s, and `inheritance` for `contract`s) and **`ContractParameter`s** (a `contract` state variable or `function` argument with properties such as data type). Each `ContractParameter` is linked to the `ContractObject` for which it is defined.

## Other notes

This repository is generally applicable to extracting the "control surface" and comments for any smart contract. The labels generated by keyword searching can be updated by modifying `config/keywords.json`

Check out the tests for details on how the data modeling, comment parsing, keyword labeling, and GitHub repo downloading is expected to behave.

# Motivation
Some applications of this work include:
- **Mapping the space**: develop a data-driven, fine-grained representation of computational governance or a new model for DAOs
- **Supporting standards creation**: inform and frontend development for end-user governance design interface
- **Conducting fundamental research**: for example, investigate the relationship between “size” of a governance surface and “requisite variety” (tradeoff between resilience and robustness; see [Zargham and Nabben, 2022](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4077358))
- **Performing audits/forensic investigation**: automate some of smart contract inspection undertaken in “governance audits,” comparable to current contract audits focused on security
- **Predict DAO performance**: build a data pipeline with which to run ML-driven workflows to analyze, predict, or optimize governance in DAOs with respect to a list of target indicators

# Hypotheses (open to contributions!)

# Practical roadmap for Metagov
1. Construct and fill a "virtual" data lake
2. Develop basic research hypotheses on top of the data (can crowdsource)
3. Test hypotheses
4. Write a paper about it
5. Use the above to identify more concrete business use-cases
6. Get businesses to fund more research + data engineering (more hypothesis formation and testing)
7. Integrate with DAOstar standards work (internally)
8. Develop and maintain public services that people can query
