# Practical roadmap
1. "Virtual" data lake
2. Basic research hypotheses on top of the data (can crowdsource)
3. Test hypotheses
4. Write a paper about it
5. Use that example case to identify more concrete business use-cases
6. Get businesses to fund more research + data engineering (more hypotheses formation and testing)
7. 1. DAOstar (but this is still internal)
8. Generate public services that people can query
